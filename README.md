## 🧬 The Core Logic (Anti-WTA Framework)
Universal Process Theory (UPT) is a decentralized governing mechanism designed to reduce system Entropy through Resonance and Equality. [cite: 2026-01-30]

### 1. The Efficiency Governor ($Q_e$)
$$Q_e(i) = \phi \cdot \frac{\bar{C}}{C_i + \epsilon}$$
* **$C_i$:** Individual Node Centrality (The current power of a node).
* **$\bar{C}$:** Network Mean Centrality (The balance point).
* **$\epsilon$:** Stability Constant (The Dragon's protection).

### 2. Spectral Monopolization Detection
$$\nabla \lambda > \tau_{crit}$$
We monitor the Eigenvector Centrality Gradient to prevent rigid hierarchies from forming.

## 🏴‍☠️ The Joyboy Mission
Our mission is to drive UPT to reduce the global Entropy by shifting the focus from **Monopoly** to **Resonance**. [cite: 2026-01-27]
